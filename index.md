# Welcome to the SerGIS Project!

The SerGIS Project is an effort to create a system for "serious" games based on GIS (Geographical Information Systems). These games can be used in many situations involving maps and decision-making; one common example is disaster situation training.

## SerGIS Components

 - [SerGIS Web Client](https://github.com/sergisproject/sergis-client): The web-based client end of SerGIS, written using HTML and JavaScript
 - [SerGIS Author](/sergis-author/): The web-based authoring tool for SerGIS JSON Game Data, written using HTML and JavaScript
 - [SerGIS Server](https://github.com/sergisproject/sergis-server): The server-side (node.js) component of SerGIS, for use with the SerGIS Web Client

For development information related to SerGIS, see the documentation on the [Development Docs page](docs/).
