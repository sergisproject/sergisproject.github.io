# Welcome to the SerGIS Project!

The SerGIS Project is an effort to create a system for "serious" games based on GIS (Geographical Information Systems). These games can be used in many situations involving maps and decision-making; one common example is disaster situation training.

There are 2 sections of the SerGIS Project: the newer SerGIS Game Engine and the older SerGIS Legacy.

## SerGIS Game Engine

The SerGIS Game Engine is a node.js-based system for developing web-based interactive games. For development information related to SerGIS Game Engine, see the documentation on the [Game Engine Developer Docs page](docs/).

## SerGIS Legacy

This system is simpler than the SerGIS Game Engine. The structure of games in SerGIS Legacy is much less customizable (for more, see the [Legacy Docs page](legacy-docs/)).

### Parts of SerGIS Legacy

 - [SerGIS Legacy Web Client](https://github.com/sergisproject/sergis-legacy-client): The web-based client end of SerGIS Legacy, written using HTML and JavaScript
 - [SerGIS Legacy Author](/sergis-legacy-author/): The web-based authoring tool SerGIS Legacy JSON Game Data, written using HTML and JavaScript
 - [SerGIS Legacy Server](https://github.com/sergisproject/sergis-legacy-server): The server-side (node.js) component of SerGIS Legacy, for use with the SerGIS Legacy Web Client

For development information related to SerGIS Legacy, see the documentation on the [Legacy Docs page](legacy-docs/).
